= Syntax

Featdoc generates mermaid diagrams in markdown for Azure wiki.

So what are the syntax escaping rules we need to obey?

== Mermaid
Comments and directives start/end with `%%`.
The word `end` causes problems.

== Markdown
Syntax can be escaped via '\'.

== Java Format
Uses e.g. `%s` for string substitution.
