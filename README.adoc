= Featdoc - Feature Documentation as Code
:toc:

featdoc

* is a documentation-as-code tool, which generates wiki pages in Markdown syntax including Mermaid diagrams.
* generates complete sequence diagrams from interacting systems, defined by simple rules

== Example
image:sequence-diagram.png[]


The example models a restaurant.
From the https://github.com/Calpano/featdoc/tree/main/src/test/java/de/xam/featdoc/example[source code], the resulting markdown is deployed to an Azure DevOps wiki, the https://dev.azure.com/itmv/Coffee%20Shop/_wiki/wikis/Coffee-Shop.wiki/3/FeatDoc[Coffee-Wiki] (and https://dev.azure.com/itmv/Coffee%20Shop/_wiki/wikis/Coffee-Shop.wiki/5/Lunch-Customer-(in-a-hurry)[here] is the sequence diagram above).

.Technical Model
* Create a `Universe`
----
Universe UNIVERSE = new Universe();
----

* Create a `System`
----
System WAITER = UNIVERSE.system("waiter", "Waiter", "Waiter");
----

* Define a `Rule` within a system (grouped by `Feature`)
----
WAITER.feature("Coffee Serving")
  .rule(orderEspresso, CoffeeMachine.espresso, MobileOrderClient.createOrder, MobileOrderClient.addItemToOrder)
  .rule(customerWantsToPay, MobileOrderClient.createBill, Customer.receiveBill);
----
* Create some more systems and rules

* Create a `Scenario`
----
Systems.UNIVERSE.scenario("Lunch-Customer (in a hurry)")
  .step(CUSTOMER, Waiter.orderEspresso)
  .step(CUSTOMER, Waiter.customerWantsToPay, "Today no credit cards");
----
* Generate in one go wiki pages for each system and each scenario

.Configuration
* The example https://github.com/Calpano/featdoc/blob/main/src/test/java/de/xam/featdoc/example/CafeWiki.java[WikiContext] defines the mermaid block style, an optional preamble for all pages, the language (en or de), as well as some paths.
* The example https://github.com/Calpano/featdoc/blob/main/src/test/java/de/xam/featdoc/example/RestaurantSystemsAndScenarios.java[technical model] is just one class. Larger models can be split up into multiple files, e.g. one per system.



== Getting Started
. Add feat as a test dependency

+
.Maven Coordinates
----
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.xam/featdoc -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.xam</groupId>
    <artifactId>featdoc</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
----
Check latest version: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.xam/featdoc[]

. Define your technical model
** Create a `Universe` -- see the <<Example>>

. Generate wiki pages
** `wikiContext`: Configure resulting wiki syntax (Azure DevOps Mermaid Blocks vs. Normal)
** Run featdoc tool
+
----
FeatDoc.generateMarkdownFiles( universe, wikiContext );
----

. Take generated wiki pages live
** For Azure DevOps wiki: Upload via `git push`



== Concept
. The core idea is to model isolated systems, each containing simple rules:
Mapping one **trigger** to multiple **actions**.
Each system has an API defined by **messages**, which are **incoming** (such as REST API calls) or **outgoing** (such as business events).
Rules are grouped into features. This just makes organising them easier.

+
.Rule
[plantuml,rule,svg]
....

package Rule {
class Trigger {
    Message
    comment
}
class Action {
    Message
    comment
}

Trigger "1" -> "n" Action : rule
}
....

. A **scenario** now merely defines an initial **trigger**, causing a chain reaction of systems sending messages to each other. As one rule can cause several actions, the result can be rendered tree-like or as a sequence diagram.

. A **message** is produced by one system (or a scenario) and consumed by zero or more systems (as defined in its rules).
** A message is defined by a system.
E.g. the vendor of the system defines the message structure and contents.
Also, the vendor will likely provides API docs for the message.
** Typical messages are *API calls* (incoming & synchronous) or *business events* (outgoing & asynchronous).

| outgoing | asynchronous a| Outgoing (business) event

== Cookbook
How do I model conditional rule actions?::
You can't. But you can add a **comment** to a rule action, which will be visible in all generated views.
+
[source, java]
----
MYSYSTEM.feature("my feature")
    .rule(triggerMessage, optionalTriggerComment)
        .action(actionMesage, optionalActionComment)
        // more actions
    .build;
----

How to represent scheduled calls?::
Define a `System` called "Scheduler" with **messages** like
+
[source, java]
----
System SCHEDULER = UNIVERSE.system("scheduler", "Scheduler", "Scheduler");
Message schedulerEvery2Minutes = SCHEDULER.asyncEventOutgoing("Every 2 Minutes");
----
and invoke them from the **scenario**.

How to model my systems?::
. Create all systems in one interface
+
[source,java]
----
interface Systems {
    Universe UNIVERSE = new Universe();
    System CUSTOMER = UNIVERSE.system("customer", "Customer", "Customer");
    System WAITER = UNIVERSE.system("waiter", "Waiter", "Waiter");
    System CM = UNIVERSE.system("coffee", "Coffee Machine", "CoffeeMachine");
    System MOC = UNIVERSE.system("moc", "Mobile Order Client", "Mobile");
    System POS = UNIVERSE.system("pos", "Point of Sale System", "POS");
    System ACC = UNIVERSE.system("accounting", "Accounting System", "Accounting");
}
----

. Model each `System`'s rules within an interface, like this
+
[source,java]
----
/** Point-of-Sale System */
interface PosSystem {

    Message createOrder = POS.apiCall("Create order for table");
    Message searchOrdersForTable = POS.apiCall("Search order of given table");
    Message addItemToOrder = POS.apiCall("Add item");
    Message addTaxesToOrder = POS.apiCall("Add taxes");

    static void define() {
        POS.feature("Tax Integration")
                .rule(addItemToOrder, AccountingSystem.calculateTax, addTaxesToOrder);
    }
}
